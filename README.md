# PID Line Follower

## Overview

Developed a PID-Controlled (propotional-Integral-Deravative) Line following robot for precise and effictive nabigation.
The hardware components include TCRT5000 sensors, Arduino Nano, L298N motor driver, 18650 batteries (2), jumpers, and N20 gear motors. 
The software part involves coding with Arduino IDE for the Arduino Nano.


## Hardware Components

- TCRT5000 sensors (3)
- Arduino Nano
- L298N motor driver
- 18650 batteries (2)
- Jumpers
- N20 gear motors
- Chassis(3D printed)

## Software Components

- Arduino IDE for Arduino Nano

## Connect the hardware components:
Follow the provided documentation to connect TCRT5000 sensors, Arduino Nano, L298N motor driver, 18650 batteries, and N20 gear motors.

## Upload the code:
Use the Arduino IDE to upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

## Usage
Place the robot on a surface with a line to follow.
The robot should follow the line using the PID control.

## Configuration
Adjust PID constants or other parameters in the code as needed for specific requirements.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
